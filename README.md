```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwykurz/weather-dashboard.git
cd weather-dashboard
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Add Your API Key**
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Get your OpenWeatherMap API key from [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### **4. Run the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
